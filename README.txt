A project for my Software Engineering class requiring us to learn how to use the
Google App Engine, the engineâ€™s database, Django templates, and other tools to build a dynamic site that takes in information in an XML format and dynamically produces web pages. The site holds three different types of pages and interconnects them together based on relativity. My contribution to the project included helping out with all the backend work (site setup, handlers, import, export, database work, Django) as well as doing all the design work for the site on my own. The site is modeled after IMDb; all the HTML and CSS was written by me and was learned at the time the site was created.
